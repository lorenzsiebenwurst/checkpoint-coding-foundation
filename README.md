# Checkpoint Coding Foundation

Solve the katas with the following requirements:

- [x] Clone this repository (on your computer)
- [x] Delete the existing remote after cloning the repository to your computer
- [x] Create a new branch called `checkpoint`
- [ ] Solve the katas on the `checkpoint` branch
- [ ] Create a new repository on GitHub called `checkpoint-coding-foundation`
  - [ ] Add this repository as the new origin remote to your local repository
- [ ] Push the commits to your GitHub repository
- [ ] Create a new pull request when your are done that will merge your `checkpoint` branch into the `main` branch
- [ ] Do not merge the branch yourself
- [ ] Assign the `codingbootcampseu` GitHub user `read` permission to your repo
- [ ] Assign the `codingbootcampseu` user as reviewer to your pull request

All three katas have test files that will be automatically executed when loading the index.html in the browser (please use VS Code Live Server for that).

## Kata: Filter API Data

Implement the `filterApiData` function in `filter-api-data.js` with the following requirements in mind.

- The first parameter `apiData` will be an array that includes objects
- The objects can have different keys
- The second parameter `mandatoryKeys` is a array that includes all keys that an object (from the `apiData` array) should have to pass the filter test
- Return an array with only the objects that include all keys from the `mandatoryKeys` array

### Filter Api Data Examples

```js
const data = [{ id: 1, price: 100 }, { price: 50 }];

const filteredData = filterApiData(data, ["id"]);

console.log(filteredData); // [{id: 1, price: 0}]
```

```js
const data = [
  { id: 1, price: 100 },
  { id: 2, title: "" },
  { id: 3, price: 50 },
];

const filteredData = filterApiData(data, ["id", "price"]);

console.log(filteredData); // [{ id: 1, price: 100 }, { id:3, price: 50}]
```

## Kata: Sum App

Implement the `SumApp` class in `sum-app.js` with the following requirements in mind.

- The `sumApp` class should have a property `numbers` which is an array
- The `sumApp` class should have a method `addNumber(n)` which will add the given number to the `numbers` array
- The `sumApp` class should have a method `getSum()` which return the sum of all numbers added to the `numbers` array
  - The `getSum()` method should return `0` if no numbers have been added to the `numbers` array
- The `sumApp` class should have a method `reset()` which should delete all numbers previously added to the `numbers` array

### Sum App Example

```js
const sumApp = new SumApp();

sumApp.addNumber(1);
sumApp.addNumber(2);

console.log(sumApp.numbers.length); // 2

console.log(sumApp.getSum()); // 3

sumApp.reset();

console.log(sumApp.numbers.length); // 0
console.log(sumApp.getSum()); // 0
```

## Zip Strings

Implement a `zipStrings` function in `zip-strings.js` with the following requirements in mind.

- The `zipStrings` function receives two string parameters
- The `zipStrings` function should return one string where the characters of both parameters are merged using the zip procedure (Rei√üverschlussverfahren)
- Merge the strings as shown in the `Zip Strings Example` code

### Zip Strings Example

```js
console.log(zipStrings("abc", "123")); // "a1b2c3"

console.log(zipStrings("abc", "1")); // "a1bc"

console.log(zipStrings("a", "123")); // "a123"

console.log(zipStrings("", "123")); // "123"

console.log(zipStrings("abc", "")); // "abc"
```
